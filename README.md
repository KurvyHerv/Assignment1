# Company XYZ's homepage

My project is a home page for company XYZ who provides a platform for individuals and companies to build professional looking websites with ease. The website displays information about why the customer should choose XYZ instead of other competitors.
The website also features a gallery showing past work done to attract customers. There is a section for potential customers to contact company XYZ for more info. 
 
## Design Process
 
 Since this website is for attracting potential customers to use XYZ for website building instead of other companies, I have designed a minimalistic website with a hero section that has a tagline to hook the customer. I have also implemented animations
 to further attract customers by showcasing the potential of using XYZ's software.

 As a user I would like to see why I should choose XYZ over other companies 
 As a user I would like to see examples of completed works by XYZ
 As a user I would like to be able to contact the company for any inquiries
